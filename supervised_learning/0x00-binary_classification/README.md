Background Context

Welcome to your first project on supervised learning! At the end of this project, you should be able to build your own binary image classifier from scratch using numpy. As you might already see, there are a LOT of resources for you to read/watch. It may be tempting to dive into the projects right away, but it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you spend AT LEAST 1 whole day going over the following materials. You should only start the project once you have a decent understanding of all the topics mentioned in Learning Objectives. You may also notice that there are multiple resources that cover the same topic, with some more technical than others. If you find yourself getting lost in a resource, move on to another and come back to the more technical one after you intuitively understand that topic. Good luck and have fun!
